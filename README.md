- Frontend listens and reacts to contract events  
- Gas cost estimation and transaction error handling  

## Branching Workflow

- **alexandra** – personal feature branch for Alexandra  
- **andra** – personal feature branch for Andra  
- **develop** – integration branch where all features are merged before review  
- **main** – stable, production-ready branch containing the final validated version
